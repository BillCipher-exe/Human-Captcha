# Human CAPTCHA Test: Real vs AI Generated Images

Welcome to the Human CAPTCHA test! you'll face off against AI-generated images. Can you tell which picture is real and which is the work of an AI sorcerer? Test your human senses and see if you're a human or... a robot! 🤖

🧠The Ideaa behind this Captcha

>The CAPTCHA test is designed to leverage the unique strengths of human perception. The underlying principle is that humans are better at recognizing subtle errors in artificial creations compared to machines. The task is to identify the real image, which tests not only the user's observational skills but also their ability to detect the often nuanced discrepancies that AI may overlook. By analyzing how effectively humans can distinguish between real and artificially generated content, this CAPTCHA aims to create a more reliable method for verifying human users in a digital environment.

🛠️ Requirements

    🐍 Python 3.x
    📦 Python packages:
        tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python)
        Pillow (for image handling)

🧙‍♂️ Installation
Clone the haunted repository:

    git clone https://github.com/BillCipher-exe/Human-Captcha.git
    cd Human-Captcha

Install the necessary potions (dependencies):


    pip install Pillow

(optional) add your own spooky images:

        🧠 AI/: Holds AI-generated images.
        🎃 Real/: Holds real, non-AI images.
            Place at least 5 images in each folder.

🕹️ Usage

Once your environment is prepared, cast the following spell in your terminal:

    python main.py

🧛‍♂️ How It Works:

    You'll be presented with 5 pairs of images. One is real, the other is AI-generated! 🎃
    Click the "Choose" button under the image you believe is real.
    After 5 rounds, you’ll either be declared Human or… Robot! 🤖

Beware, mortal! Only those with sharp eyes can escape the AI’s trap! 🔮
